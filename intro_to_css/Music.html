  <main><h2>Effects of Music</h2>
<hr>
<p>Beneath the sun's warm, golden embrace,
  Upon the shore, a tranquil space,
  Where waves caress with gentle grace,
  I find my haven, a peaceful place.
  
  Soft sands beneath, a soothing bed,
  Where worries ebb and stress is shed,
  Seagulls' songs dance overhead,
  As whispered secrets, shells have said.
  
  Azure skies stretch infinitely wide,
  Waters shimmer with the changing tide,
  Footprints fade as the minutes slide,
  In this moment, all cares subside.
  
  With every breath of salty air,
  A tranquil calm beyond compare,
  The beach's magic, beyond compare,
  Rela>xes soul and lightens care.</p>

<h3> Benefits of Music</h3>
<hr>
<p> Music can have a profound effect on both the emotions and the body. Faster music can make you feel more alert and concentrate better. Upbeat music can make you feel more optimistic and positive about life. A slower tempo can quiet your mind and relax your muscles, making you feel soothed while releasing the stress of the day. Music is effective for relaxation and stress management.

  Research confirms these personal experiences with music. Current findings indicate that music around 60 beats per minute can cause the brain to synchronize with the beat causing alpha brainwaves (frequencies from 8 - 14 hertz or cycles per second). This alpha brainwave is what is present when we are relaxed and conscious. To induce sleep (a delta brainwave of 5 hertz), a person may need to devote at least 45 minutes, in a relaxed position, listening to calming music. Researchers at Stanford University have said that "listening to music seems to be able to change brain functioning to the same extent as medication." They noted that music is something that almost anybody can access and makes it an easy stress reduction tool.</p>
