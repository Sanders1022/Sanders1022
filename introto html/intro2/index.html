    <h2> Welcome to my website</h2>

    <p>Who Am I? 
    I am not a cloak to those who cannot handle the real me when I walk into the room. I am the one who owns the room with her spirit. I am not a watered-down drink blending in with the crowd of my elite peers. I am a lioness with a loud roar that is as gentle as a snowflake. I am not my hair nor my skin, but my power comes from within. I am not aggression, that comes from not being heard, or not being good enough. I am the fire that burns inside me for change which grows bigger and bigger with the flame. I am not the live-in babysitter, or the house cleaner I am above and not beneath. I am the tall tree in the forest that guides the wind as to which direction to blow. I am not a product of my environment. I am in my environment stretching my hand to pull you up when they knock you down. I am courage that tells you do not back down GOD is with you through it all. I am not a silent night in the winter. I am the storm that roars with thunder and leaves a beautiful rainbow at the end. I am not the little colored girl who needs your sympathy. I am BLACK EXCELLENCE and I rise with the sun.</p>
